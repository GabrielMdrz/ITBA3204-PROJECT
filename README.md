# DEVELOPING SOCIETIES WITH PEACE, JUSTICE, AND EQUITABLE: EXPLORING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16

## Introduction
  Sustainable development cannot be without peace and security; and peace and security  will be at risk without sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda recognizes the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights, on effective rule of law and good governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable institutions. SDG 16 – promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels – has been identified at the Conference on SDG 16 as a Goal that is both an outcome and an enabler of sustainable development. SDG 16 is closely interlinked with other SDGs. Without peace, justice and inclusion, achieving goals such as ending poverty, ensuring education, promoting economic growth can be difficult or impossible. At the same time, various SDGs can help or hinder the achievement of SDG 16, for instance climate change can act as a threat multiplier, aggravating additional social, environmental and political stressors, conditions that could possibly lead to violence.
  Progress towards SDG 16 is a universal challenge which requires action for implementation and follow up in both developing and developed countries, albeit in different ways. In many countries, capacity needs and gaps represent a critical barrier to meaningful SDG 16 implementation and follow-up. These capacity issues are often, though not exclusively, felt in countries that are post-conflict, transitioning out of conflict,fragile, or least developed. At the same time, in many developed and emerging countries (though again not exclusively so), violence against women and children continues to threaten their well-being and pose obstacles to realizing their full potential. Issues such as social cohesion, illicit financial flows, corruption and many forms of discrimination remain grave challenges.
  Member States and the international community need to do more in preventing and eradicating conflict, even as they support to improve lives of those living in conflict affected regions by reducing the drivers of violent conflict and improving ways to reach marginalized populations affected by conflict and making progress on the SDGs. As enshrined in SDG 16, the 2030 Agenda calls for transparent, effective, inclusive and accountable institutions to advance poverty eradication and sustainable development. It aims to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. SDG 16 emphasizes the central role of institutions and effective decision-making in reaching the SDGs.
  As with the rest of the 2030 Agenda, while governments have a leading role to play, the achievement of SDG 16 depends on a whole-of-society approach. Civil society
organizations are involved in multiple ways, as implementers and as advocates for underrepresented parts of the population such as women, youth and marginalized groups. For its part, the private sector can also make an important contribution to efforts towards peacebuilding, inclusion, advancing the rule of law and eliminating corruption as fundamental to creating an environment conducive to development where business can thrive. Local governments, parliamentarians and the academia are other critical stakeholders in the implementation of SDG 16 and the 2030 Agenda as a whole.

## Problem Statement
Sustainable development goals 16 is focused on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. It is an essential goal, as it aims to ensure that people can exercise their rights, create more equal and peaceful communities, and achieve sustainable development.[^7].

However, one of the significant problems with this goal is that the primary focus is on addressing the symptoms of the problem rather than solving the root cause. The root cause of social inequality, injustice, and weak institutions is deep-seated power imbalances that make it challenging to bring about systemic change. Addressing these power imbalances requires not only political will but also strong leadership and the resources required to effect change.[^8].

Moreover, there has been a lack of collaboration among countries, organizations, and individuals in achieving this goal. Many countries are grappling with their internal issues, hindering their ability to help others. For example, in some countries, promoting peace and justice may not be a priority, with officials focusing more on consolidating power or enriching themselves. This lack of coherence in approach can result in sustainable development becoming elusive for millions of people. Thus, to achieve goal 16, there is a need to create strong partnerships across different countries and sectors committed to promoting and mobilizing resources for this goal.[^9].

In conclusion, achieving SDG 16 is crucial for the attainment of all other sustainable development goals. However, the goal is hampered by the lack of concerted effort and collaboration among countries, institutions, and individuals. The promotion of sustainable development can only be achieved by addressing issues at the root- the power imbalances that exist, and by working together to create effective and inclusive systems that work for all people. To bring about systemic change, governments must be more accountable, policies more transparent, and all stakeholders included in decision-making processes.[^10].

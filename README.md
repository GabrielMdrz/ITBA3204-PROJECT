# Project Title: War on Drugs in the Philippines

## Introduction
The War on Drugs is a term used to describe the global campaign to combat the production, distribution, and use of illegal drugs. The term was first used by U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971, and since then, it has been adopted by governments around the world. The goal of the War on Drugs is to reduce drug use and drug-related crime by targeting drug producers, traffickers, and users. However, the effectiveness of this approach has been widely debated, with some arguing that it has led to increased violence, corruption, and human rights abuses.[^1][^2]

The War on Drugs has been characterized by a range of policies and strategies, including increased law enforcement, stricter drug laws, and anti-drug education and outreach programs. One of the most controversial aspects of the War on Drugs has been the use of harsh criminal penalties for drug offenses, including mandatory minimum sentences and three-strikes laws. Critics argue that these policies have disproportionately affected people of color and low-income communities, and have led to mass incarceration and a range of other negative social consequences.[^3].

The War on Drugs in the Philippines, also known as Operation Double Barrel, has been characterized by a brutal crackdown on drug users and dealers. Since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016, thousands of people have been killed in police operations or by vigilante groups, with many more arrested and detained. The government has defended its actions as necessary to combat the country's drug problem, but human rights groups have raised concerns about extrajudicial killings and other abuses.[^4].

According to Human Rights Watch, the Philippine government's War on Drugs has resulted in "widespread and systematic" violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and torture. The group has called on the government to end its abusive campaign and hold those responsible accountable. However, the government has resisted calls for an independent investigation and has even withdrawn from the International Criminal Court, which was investigating the situation in the country.[^5].

# Project Title: Justice over War on Drugs in the Philippines
***This repository is for our requirement in BAT404 - Analytics Techniques and Tools (IT 3204)***

## Introduction
  The Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) completed a review into 52 deaths during police anti-drug operations (Manila Bulletin, 3 October 2021), concluding that criminal charges ought to be levied against 154 police officers (Reuters, 4 October 2021). This marks a rare admission by the Philippine state that it may be complicit in abuses stemming from the war on drugs — which continues to rage on. While the 52 deaths under investigation represent a very small fraction of drug war fatalities, the justice minister announced last month that the DOJ will now look into thousands of other killings that have resulted from anti-drug operations (Reuters, 20 October 2021). Following the announcement, President Rodrigo Duterte stated his admission of full responsibility for the drug war, though “maintained he will never be tried by an international court” (Reuters, 21 October 2021). His comments came as the judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) approved a formal investigation into possible crimes against humanity committed under his leadership (Reuters, 15 September 2021).

The government admits that over 6,000 killings have occurred during police operations in association with the drug war. Many officers, however, have already been absolved of any wrongdoing in those incidents during internal police investigations. While the DOJ’s plan to review these killings is a welcome step for many victims’ families, analysis of new ACLED data finds that the civilian toll of the war on drugs, perpetrated by the state and its supporters, is much higher than the official figures suggest: at least 7,742 Philippine civilians have been killed in anti-drug operations since 2016, 25% higher than the government’s count, even by a conservative estimate. While the overall rate of violence has declined since the height of the drug war in 2016, when Duterte first took office, there have been important changes in trends, including a shift in the primary perpetrators of the war, as well as the geography of violence. 

Anti-drug ‘vigilantes’ — largely assumed to have links to the Philippine security infrastructure — were responsible for nearly half, over 48%, of civilian targeting during the early days of the drug war in 2016. Since 2020, however, there has been an upward trend in the proportion of state involvement in drug war violence. The Philippine state has taken an increasingly large role in targeting civilians itself, no longer trying to create distance by ‘outsourcing’ the majority of violence to vigilantes. So far in 2021, state forces have accounted for 80% of civilian targeting in the drug war. The shift appears to be driven by increased scrutiny around vigilantes by the media and international community, as well as dynamics around competing state priorities as the government fights other wars along multiple fronts. 

The geography of violence too has shifted, from Metro Manila to Central Luzon, initially coinciding with the reassignment of top police officials from the former to the latter (Rappler, 24 February 2019). More recently, new frontiers have emerged within Central Luzon, with violence shifting from Bulacan province to Nueva Ecija province — now the epicenter of the drug war — as police in Central Luzon continue to be rewarded by the Duterte administration.

The war on drugs launched by President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines in 2016 is a highly controversial issue that has been a topic of debate among human rights advocates and lawmakers on a global level. The President's motivation stemmed from his promises to crack down on drug-related issues, bringing profound changes to the country's approach to drug abuse ultimately. Duterte has claimed that his crackdown on drugs aims at resolving the drug menace in the country, and his supporters argue that these actions are necessary to make the streets safer.

Despite the initial assertions that the war on drugs was getting successful, the war on drugs has been subject to criticisms locally and internationally. Human rights advocates argue that the Duterte administration's efforts to combat drugs have led to extrajudicial killings and other forms of human rights exploitation. Nearly 6,000 people were killed within the first six months of the so-called 'war on drugs' crackdown, allegedly including the innocent, worsening the drug problem instead. It has been suggested that the need for police intervention and due process is required in addressing the drug issue, rather than violent approaches that pull the country away from values-based governance.

The seriousness of the drug problem in the Philippines cannot be overemphasized. However, whether or not the President's administration's methods are going to be effective long-term remains an issue that will not be resolved overnight. The broader problem with the war on drugs in the Philippines is that it has provided a precedent for authoritarian governance that spends recklessly on military and extrajudicial campaigns.

To sum up, this analysis focuses on the SDG 10, which is to ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies, and action in this regard, as well as the SDG 16, which calls for peaceful and inclusive societies based on respect for human rights, protection of the most vulnerable, the rule of law, and good governance at all levels.The objective of this analysis is to observe the rates of crimes in the Philippines, especially those involving illegal drugs.

## Problem Statement
Since the inauguration of President Rodrigo Duterte on June 30, 2016, and his call for a “war on drugs,” Philippine National Police officers and unidentified “vigilantes” have killed over 7,000 people. The anti-drug campaign dubbed “Operation Double Barrel” has targeted suspected drug dealers and users ostensibly for arrest but in practice has been a campaign of extrajudicial execution in impoverished areas of Manila and other urban areas. Duterte’s outspoken endorsement of the campaign implicates him and other senior officials in possible incitement to violence, instigation of murder, and in command responsibility for crimes against humanity.

Hitler massacred three million Jews. Now, there are three million drug addicts. I’d be happy to slaughter them. If Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have (me). 
― Rodrigo Duterte, September 30, 2016

This report examines 24 incidents, resulting in 32 deaths, involving Philippine National Police personnel between October 2016 and January 2017. Human Rights Watch found that the official police reports of these incidents invariably asserted self-defense to justify police killings, contrary to eyewitness accounts that portray the killings as cold-blooded murders of unarmed drug suspects in custody. To bolster their claims, the police routinely planted guns, spent ammunition, and drug packets next to the victims’ bodies. No one has been meaningfully investigated, let alone prosecuted, for these killings.

Before being elected president, Rodrigo Duterte was the mayor of Davao City for more than two decades. There, the “Davao Death Squad” had killed hundreds of drug users, street children, and other petty criminals. While denying involvement in the death squads, Duterte endorsed their killings as an effective way to combat crime, relishing his “Duterte Harry” nickname and reputation.

Even prior to announcing his candidacy for the May 2016 presidential election, Duterte was already very clear about his intention to eliminate crime by eliminating criminals: “If by chance that God will place me there, watch out because the 1,000 [people allegedly executed while Duterte was mayor of Davao City] will become 100,000. You will see the fish in Manila Bay getting fat. That is where I will dump you.”

Duterte’s outspoken vow to embark on a nationwide killing campaign against drug dealers and drug users was the foundation of his presidential electoral platform. During a campaign rally on March 15, 2016, for example, he stated: “When I become president, I will order the police to find those people [dealing or using drugs] and kill them. The funeral parlors will be packed.”

Following his election, Duterte continued to state unequivocally that his anti-drug campaign would focus on killing drug dealers and users. Speaking in Davao City on June 4, he stated: “If you are still into drugs, I am going to kill you. Don’t take this as a joke. I’m not trying to make you laugh. Sons of bitches, I’ll really kill you.”

Since taking office, Duterte has repeatedly vowed to kill drug dealers and users in the midst of skyrocketing reports of extrajudicial executions by the police and so-called vigilantes. On August 6, he warned drug dealers: “My order is shoot to kill you. I don’t care about human rights; you better believe me.” He praised the soaring body count of victims of police killings as proof of the “success” of his “war on drugs.”

The official death toll does not include those killed by unidentified gunmen whom Human Rights Watch and other rights monitors have credible evidence to believe operate in cooperation with local police and officials. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) calculated in a 2020 report that the death toll was at least 8,663. Domestic human rights groups and the government-appointed Philippine Commission on Human Rights state that the real number of “drug war” killings is possibly triple the number included in the UN report.  

The scale of the “drug war” killings prompted the then-ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to announce in February 2018 the opening of a preliminary examination over the deaths, many of which are linked to “extrajudicial killings in the course of police anti-drug operations.” In May 2021, following her analysis of these crimes, Bensouda requested the court’s authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines. The ICC pre-trial chamber authorized the opening of the investigation in September 2021.

## Significance of the Proposed Project
The campaign against illegal drugs continued in the Philippines, even after the term of former President Duterte ended. In 2021, the National Capital Region and Region 4-A recorded the highest number of arrested persons involved in illegal drugs. With high rates of criminality and limited prison capacity, prison facilities across the country have long been faced with overcrowding issues, in which most inmates were serving sentences without conviction. As of July 2021, there were over 215 thousand prisoners in just 40 prison facilities nationwide. The country’s prison situation was also characterized by high death tolls, with the total tally reaching about 1,200 in 2021. This project's goal is to provide an explanatory analysis of the crime rates involving drugs in the Philippines through the years. This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying crime rates in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

**The Students**. For those students who will be needing data that may be found in the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines crime rates over the course of time.

**The Teachers**. For teachers who will be teaching about law, which involves crime in the Philippines over the course of many years. The information collected for the project can be used in their courses.

**The Government officials**. For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use for their future projects related to crimes involving drugs.

**The Future Researchers**. For the researchers to provide background knowledge concerning crime rates in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.

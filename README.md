# Project Title: War on Drugs in the Philippines

## Introduction
The War on Drugs is a term used to describe the global campaign to combat the production, distribution, and use of illegal drugs. The term was first used by U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971, and since then, it has been adopted by governments around the world. The goal of the War on Drugs is to reduce drug use and drug-related crime by targeting drug producers, traffickers, and users. However, the effectiveness of this approach has been widely debated, with some arguing that it has led to increased violence, corruption, and human rights abuses.[^1][^2]

The War on Drugs has been characterized by a range of policies and strategies, including increased law enforcement, stricter drug laws, and anti-drug education and outreach programs. One of the most controversial aspects of the War on Drugs has been the use of harsh criminal penalties for drug offenses, including mandatory minimum sentences and three-strikes laws. Critics argue that these policies have disproportionately affected people of color and low-income communities, and have led to mass incarceration and a range of other negative social consequences.[^3].

The War on Drugs in the Philippines, also known as Operation Double Barrel, has been characterized by a brutal crackdown on drug users and dealers. Since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016, thousands of people have been killed in police operations or by vigilante groups, with many more arrested and detained. The government has defended its actions as necessary to combat the country's drug problem, but human rights groups have raised concerns about extrajudicial killings and other abuses.[^4].

According to Human Rights Watch, the Philippine government's War on Drugs has resulted in "widespread and systematic" violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and torture. The group has called on the government to end its abusive campaign and hold those responsible accountable. However, the government has resisted calls for an independent investigation and has even withdrawn from the International Criminal Court, which was investigating the situation in the country.[^5].

To sum up, this analysis focuses on the sixteenth which is to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The objective of this analysis is to [^6].

## Problem Statement
Sustainable development goals 16 is focused on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. It is an essential goal, as it aims to ensure that people can exercise their rights, create more equal and peaceful communities, and achieve sustainable development.[^7].

However, one of the significant problems with this goal is that the primary focus is on addressing the symptoms of the problem rather than solving the root cause. The root cause of social inequality, injustice, and weak institutions is deep-seated power imbalances that make it challenging to bring about systemic change. Addressing these power imbalances requires not only political will but also strong leadership and the resources required to effect change.[^8].

Moreover, there has been a lack of collaboration among countries, organizations, and individuals in achieving this goal. Many countries are grappling with their internal issues, hindering their ability to help others. For example, in some countries, promoting peace and justice may not be a priority, with officials focusing more on consolidating power or enriching themselves. This lack of coherence in approach can result in sustainable development becoming elusive for millions of people. Thus, to achieve goal 16, there is a need to create strong partnerships across different countries and sectors committed to promoting and mobilizing resources for this goal.[^9].

In conclusion, achieving SDG 16 is crucial for the attainment of all other sustainable development goals. However, the goal is hampered by the lack of concerted effort and collaboration among countries, institutions, and individuals. The promotion of sustainable development can only be achieved by addressing issues at the root- the power imbalances that exist, and by working together to create effective and inclusive systems that work for all people. To bring about systemic change, governments must be more accountable, policies more transparent, and all stakeholders included in decision-making processes.[^10].


## Significance of the Proposed Project
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. Goal 16 of the SDGs focuses on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, ensuring access to justice, and building effective and accountable institutions. The significance of the study on SDG 16 lies in the fact that achieving this goal is critical to the overall success of the SDGs.[^11].

Achieving SDG 16 requires addressing the root causes of conflict and violence, promoting access to justice, building effective and inclusive institutions, and improving public participation and accountability. This goal is particularly critical in conflict-affected and fragile states, where weak institutions, corruption, and human rights violations are prevalent. The study on SDG 16 aims to identify the specific challenges and opportunities in achieving this goal, and develop evidence-based strategies for promoting peace, justice, and equitable institutions.[^12].

Moreover, SDG 16 is interconnected with other SDGs, particularly SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Addressing the root causes of conflict and violence, promoting access to justice, and building inclusive and accountable institutions are central to promoting sustainable development and achieving other SDGs. Thus, the study on SDG 16 contributes to a broader understanding of the interlinkages between the different SDGs and the need for an integrated approach to sustainable development. Ultimately, achieving SDG 16 will help build a more peaceful, just, and equitable world.[^13].

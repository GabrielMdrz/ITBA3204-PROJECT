# DEVELOPING SOCIETIES WITH PEACE, JUSTICE, AND EQUITABLE: EXPLORING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16

## Introduction
  The Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) completed a review into 52 deaths during police anti-drug operations (Manila Bulletin, 3 October 2021), concluding that criminal charges ought to be levied against 154 police officers (Reuters, 4 October 2021). This marks a rare admission by the Philippine state that it may be complicit in abuses stemming from the war on drugs — which continues to rage on. While the 52 deaths under investigation represent a very small fraction of drug war fatalities, the justice minister announced last month that the DOJ will now look into thousands of other killings that have resulted from anti-drug operations (Reuters, 20 October 2021). Following the announcement, President Rodrigo Duterte stated his admission of full responsibility for the drug war, though “maintained he will never be tried by an international court” (Reuters, 21 October 2021). His comments came as the judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) approved a formal investigation into possible crimes against humanity committed under his leadership (Reuters, 15 September 2021).

The government admits that over 6,000 killings have occurred during police operations in association with the drug war. Many officers, however, have already been absolved of any wrongdoing in those incidents during internal police investigations. While the DOJ’s plan to review these killings is a welcome step for many victims’ families, analysis of new ACLED data finds that the civilian toll of the war on drugs, perpetrated by the state and its supporters, is much higher than the official figures suggest: at least 7,742 Philippine civilians have been killed in anti-drug operations since 2016, 25% higher than the government’s count, even by a conservative estimate. While the overall rate of violence has declined since the height of the drug war in 2016, when Duterte first took office, there have been important changes in trends, including a shift in the primary perpetrators of the war, as well as the geography of violence. 

Anti-drug ‘vigilantes’ — largely assumed to have links to the Philippine security infrastructure — were responsible for nearly half, over 48%, of civilian targeting during the early days of the drug war in 2016. Since 2020, however, there has been an upward trend in the proportion of state involvement in drug war violence. The Philippine state has taken an increasingly large role in targeting civilians itself, no longer trying to create distance by ‘outsourcing’ the majority of violence to vigilantes. So far in 2021, state forces have accounted for 80% of civilian targeting in the drug war. The shift appears to be driven by increased scrutiny around vigilantes by the media and international community, as well as dynamics around competing state priorities as the government fights other wars along multiple fronts.  

The geography of violence too has shifted, from Metro Manila to Central Luzon, initially coinciding with the reassignment of top police officials from the former to the latter (Rappler, 24 February 2019). More recently, new frontiers have emerged within Central Luzon, with violence shifting from Bulacan province to Nueva Ecija province — now the epicenter of the drug war — as police in Central Luzon continue to be rewarded by the Duterte administration.

The war on drugs launched by President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines in 2016 is a highly controversial issue that has been a topic of debate among human rights advocates and lawmakers on a global level. The President's motivation stemmed from his promises to crack down on drug-related issues, bringing profound changes to the country's approach to drug abuse ultimately. Duterte has claimed that his crackdown on drugs aims at resolving the drug menace in the country, and his supporters argue that these actions are necessary to make the streets safer.

Despite the initial assertions that the war on drugs was getting successful, the war on drugs has been subject to criticisms locally and internationally. Human rights advocates argue that the Duterte administration's efforts to combat drugs have led to extrajudicial killings and other forms of human rights exploitation. Nearly 6,000 people were killed within the first six months of the so-called 'war on drugs' crackdown, allegedly including the innocent, worsening the drug problem instead. It has been suggested that the need for police intervention and due process is required in addressing the drug issue, rather than violent approaches that pull the country away from values-based governance.

The seriousness of the drug problem in the Philippines cannot be overemphasized. However, whether or not the President's administration's methods are going to be effective long-term remains an issue that will not be resolved overnight. The broader problem with the war on drugs in the Philippines is that it has provided a precedent for authoritarian governance that spends recklessly on military and extrajudicial campaigns

## Problem Statement
Sustainable development goals 16 is focused on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. It is an essential goal, as it aims to ensure that people can exercise their rights, create more equal and peaceful communities, and achieve sustainable development.[^7].

However, one of the significant problems with this goal is that the primary focus is on addressing the symptoms of the problem rather than solving the root cause. The root cause of social inequality, injustice, and weak institutions is deep-seated power imbalances that make it challenging to bring about systemic change. Addressing these power imbalances requires not only political will but also strong leadership and the resources required to effect change.[^8].

Moreover, there has been a lack of collaboration among countries, organizations, and individuals in achieving this goal. Many countries are grappling with their internal issues, hindering their ability to help others. For example, in some countries, promoting peace and justice may not be a priority, with officials focusing more on consolidating power or enriching themselves. This lack of coherence in approach can result in sustainable development becoming elusive for millions of people. Thus, to achieve goal 16, there is a need to create strong partnerships across different countries and sectors committed to promoting and mobilizing resources for this goal.[^9].

In conclusion, achieving SDG 16 is crucial for the attainment of all other sustainable development goals. However, the goal is hampered by the lack of concerted effort and collaboration among countries, institutions, and individuals. The promotion of sustainable development can only be achieved by addressing issues at the root- the power imbalances that exist, and by working together to create effective and inclusive systems that work for all people. To bring about systemic change, governments must be more accountable, policies more transparent, and all stakeholders included in decision-making processes.[^10].
